# Auntie Server

Auntie.cc is a B2C fullstack application which enables customers to promote their favourite stalls and events by snapping a picture and uploading the details to the website. It is also able to allow retail shop owners to upload their inventory to be searchable by people.
However I did not market this side project, and have since shutdown the website.
